# 🧠 Object Detection using SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)

This repository contains an implementation of an Object Detection system using the **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)** algorithm with a pre-trained deep learning model. The system can detect and localize multiple objects in real-time from images and video streams.
